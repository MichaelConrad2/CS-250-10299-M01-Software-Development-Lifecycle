Reflection Draft
1. Interpreting User Needs & Implementing Them into a Program

Throughout the SNHU Travel wellness application project, I learned how crucial it is to translate user needs into actionable requirements. As the Product Owner, I gathered client expectations and expressed them as user stories—for example, “As a traveler, I want to search for wellness retreats by location and duration so that I can easily plan my trip.”
User stories helped clarify value, prioritize development work, and guide acceptance criteria. They also bridged communication between technical and non-technical team members, ensuring that user intent consistently shaped implementation. This practice exemplified Agile’s emphasis on customer collaboration and value delivery.

2. Approach to Developing Programs & Agile Processes for Future Work

My approach to software development has shifted toward iterative, feedback-driven cycles rather than linear plans. Using Scrum, we built and tested small increments, reviewed them regularly, and incorporated stakeholder input in every sprint.
In my future development work, I intend to continue applying Scrum artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Burndown Charts) and ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives) to maintain transparency and adaptability. The Agile mindset—embracing change and continuous improvement—proved vital for responding efficiently to new requirements like SNHU Travel’s mid-project pivot.

3. Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Good teamwork in software development means communication, accountability, and collaboration. During this project, clear dialogue between the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and developers maintained alignment even when priorities changed. I learned that psychological safety and open discussion during retrospectives help teams surface issues early and improve together.
Agile teams thrive when members share ownership of success; everyone contributes ideas, respects roles, and focuses on delivering value rather than just completing tasks. This experience reinforced that strong team dynamics are as critical to project success as technical skill.
